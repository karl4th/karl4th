## 👤 About Me

I am a **Founder and Lead ML Engineer** dedicated to building the next generation of intelligent systems. My work focuses on moving beyond static architectures to create a unified, adaptive ecosystem under the **Manifestro** vision.

* **Founder:** Leading architectural innovation at Manifestro.
* **Architect:** Author of the **NNAI-S** (Neural Network Active Inference with STDP) specification — bridging the gap between biological plasticity and modern SSMs.
* **Engineer:** Hands-on specialist in **PyTorch**, focusing on **Acoustic Modeling**, **Liquid Neural Networks (LNN)**, and **Predictive Coding**.
* **Hardware:** Developing and training high-load models on a **MacBook Air (M-series)** environment integrated with **Google Colab** clusters.

## 🏗 The Stack (Manifestro)

### **Core Systems**
* **[nnai](https://github.com/Manifestro/nnai)**: Implementation of the **NNAI-S** architecture. It integrates "Fast Weights" and Surprise Gating to enable real-time adaptation to non-stationary data (like speech) without catastrophic forgetting.
* **Aethor**: Foundational data acquisition platform. The entry point for high-quality, structured information.

### **Acoustic & Audio Intelligence (Sanday)**
* **[sanday-listen-lnn](https://github.com/Manifestro/sanday-listen-lnn)**: Leveraging Liquid Neural Networks for adaptive acoustic processing, inspired by NNAI-S principles.
* **Sanday-Acoustic**: Our core acoustic model (currently in R&D/Training phase). Focused on high-precision sequence recognition and rapid speaker adaptation.
* **Sanday-VAD**: High-precision Voice Activity Detection optimized for noisy environments.

### **Language & Transcription**
* **Scribe-LM**: Specialized language modeling and transcription processing within the Manifestro ecosystem.

## 🛠 Engineering & R&D
I focus on architectural innovation that allows models to "learn while they work":
* **NNAI-S Mechanics:** Predictive coding for perception error, low-rank "Fast Weight" updates, and biological "sleep" cycles for memory consolidation.
* **Frameworks:** Python & PyTorch.
* **Concepts:** Active Inference, STDP-plasticity, and Information Homeostasis.

## 📈 Status: Phase 1
The **NNAI-S Architecture Specification (v0.1)** is ready. Current efforts are focused on experimental validation: achieving $WER \le 8\%$ on ASR tasks while demonstrating near-instant adaptation to new speakers.
