## 👤 About Me

I am a **Founder and Lead ML Engineer** dedicated to building the next generation of intelligent systems. My work focuses on moving beyond static architectures to create a unified, adaptive ecosystem under the **Manifestro** vision.

* **Founder:** Leading architectural innovation at Manifestro.
* [cite_start]**Architect:** Author of the **NNAI-S** (Neural Network Active Inference with STDP) specification — bridging the gap between biological plasticity and modern SSMs[cite: 4, 7, 14].
* [cite_start]**Engineer:** Hands-on specialist in **PyTorch**, focusing on **Acoustic Modeling**, **Liquid Neural Networks (LNN)**, and **Predictive Coding**[cite: 18, 71].
* **Hardware:** Developing and training high-load models on a **MacBook Air (M-series)** environment integrated with **Google Colab** clusters.

## 🏗 The Stack (Manifestro)

### **Core Systems**
* **[nnai](https://github.com/Manifestro/nnai)**: Implementation of the **NNAI-S** architecture. [cite_start]It integrates "Fast Weights" and Surprise Gating to enable real-time adaptation to non-stationary data (like speech) without catastrophic forgetting[cite: 9, 10].
* **Aethor**: Foundational data acquisition platform. The entry point for high-quality, structured information.

### **Acoustic & Audio Intelligence (Sanday)**
* **[sanday-listen-lnn](https://github.com/Manifestro/sanday-listen-lnn)**: Leveraging Liquid Neural Networks for adaptive acoustic processing, inspired by NNAI-S principles.
* **Sanday-Acoustic**: Our core acoustic model (currently in R&D/Training phase). [cite_start]Focused on high-precision sequence recognition and rapid speaker adaptation[cite: 119].
* [cite_start]**Sanday-VAD**: High-precision Voice Activity Detection optimized for noisy environments[cite: 120].

### **Language & Transcription**
* **Scribe-LM**: Specialized language modeling and transcription processing within the Manifestro ecosystem.

## 🛠 Engineering & R&D
I focus on architectural innovation that allows models to "learn while they work":
* [cite_start]**NNAI-S Mechanics:** Predictive coding for perception error, low-rank "Fast Weight" updates, and biological "sleep" cycles for memory consolidation[cite: 9, 46, 60].
* **Frameworks:** Python & PyTorch.
* [cite_start]**Concepts:** Active Inference, STDP-plasticity, and Information Homeostasis[cite: 7, 10, 32].

## 📈 Status: Phase 1
The **NNAI-S Architecture Specification (v0.1)** is ready. [cite_start]Current efforts are focused on experimental validation: achieving $WER \le 8\%$ on ASR tasks while demonstrating near-instant adaptation to new speakers[cite: 3, 138].
