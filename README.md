## 🛠 Engineering & R&D
I focus on high-load training and architectural innovation, leveraging:
* **Frameworks:** Python & PyTorch.
* **Concepts:** Implementing World Models & V-JEPA architectures.
* **Current Goal:** Optimizing **SandayAcoustic** training metrics and implementing the principles of the new Manifestro document.

## 📈 Status: Phase 1
The **Manifestro** document is complete. We are currently moving from architectural theory to intensive training and integration of the **Sanday** and **Scribe** components.
